# Spatiotemporal risk of infection of care homes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK

Can risk of introduction of covid-19 infection to care homes be predicted by estimates of community prevalence in the immediately surrounding area?

This is the code and configuration for our paper, _name goes here_

* The paper is [here]()
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are in `released_analysis_results/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the code should review
[DEVELOPERS.md](./docs/DEVELOPERS.md).
